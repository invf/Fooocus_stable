[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/invf/Fooocus_stable/blob/main/fooocus_colab.ipynb) | Fooocus Official

In Colab, you can modify the last line to `!python entry_with_update.py --share` or `!python entry_with_update.py --preset anime --share` or `!python entry_with_update.py --preset realistic --share` for Fooocus Default/Anime/Realistic Edition.

Note that this Colab will disable refiner by default because Colab free's resources are relatively limited (and some "big" features like image prompt may cause free-tier Colab to disconnect). We make sure that basic text-to-image is always working on free-tier Colab.
